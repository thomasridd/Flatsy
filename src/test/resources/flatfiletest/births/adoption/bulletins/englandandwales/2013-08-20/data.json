Figures on adoption orders apply to adoptions by relatives and step-parents as well as adoptions from care.\n\nStatistics on adoptions are derived from the Adopted Children Register (ACR) which is maintained by the General Register Office (GRO) and contains the particulars of every adoption order made by a court in England and Wales. Children born and adopted overseas can be registered in the ACR providing the adoptive parent(s) are habitually resident in England or Wales at the time of the adoption. Such adoptions are not included in the Office for National Statistics (ONS) adoption statistics.\n\nThis is the first time that ONS has published annual 2012 adoption statistics for England and Wales. Adoption statistics are analysed by sex, age and marital status of the biological parents.\n\nSince 2013, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has published adoption statistics in [Court Statistics (Quarterly).](http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/court-statistics-quarterly-jan-mar-2013) These statistics are more timely and contain more detailed information than ONS can provide. ONS plans to consult with users over the summer on the possible discontinuation of some ONS products and ONS Adoption Statistics will be included within this [consultation](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/consultations/open-consultations/index.html).\n\nThe number of adoption orders indicated by ONS and MoJ are similar but do not match exactly. A [published statement on the differences](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/media-centre/statements/statement-on-the-differences-between-office-for-national-statistics-and-ministry-of-justice-figures-on-adoptions/index.html) provides more information.\n"},{"title":"Number of adoptions","markdown":"In 2012, there were 5,206 adoptions entered into the Adopted Children Register (ACR) following court orders made in England and Wales. This was higher than in 2011 (a 9.8% increase), when there were 4,740 adoptions. This represents the largest annual increase in adoptions over the last 15 years, the period for which adoption statistics by date of court order are available (Figure 1).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/adoption/bulletins/adoptionsinenglandandwales/2013-08-20/67e1851a\" />\n\n\n\nWales recorded a 12% increase in adoptions in 2012 with 371 children entered into the Adopted Children Register following court orders made by courts in Wales. In England there was a 9.6% rise in adoptions with 4,835 children entered into the Adopted Children Register following court orders made in England.\n\nIn December 2011, an Expert Working Group on Adoption was established and commissioned by the Government. The aim of the group was to urgently review the operation of adoption in England following concerns about the effectiveness of adoption services. [An Action Plan for Adoption: Tacking Delay](http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/a/an%20action%20plan%20for%20adoption.pdf \"An Action Plan for Adoption: Tacking Delay\") was published in March 2012 and outlines what the Government intends to do to accelerate the whole adoption process in England so that more children benefit from adoption and more rapidly.\n\nFollowing on from this review, the Department for Education published new [Adoption Scorecards](http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/families/adoption/a00208817/adoption-scorecards \"Adoption Scorecards\") for England in May 2012. These are updated annually and show, against three key indicators, how swiftly children in need of adoption are placed for adoption, in each local authority area. The scorecards allow local authorities and other adoption agencies to monitor their own performance and compare it with that of others.\n\nAn in-depth inquiry into adoption in Wales was also conducted and recommendations from this were published ([National Assembly for Wales, 2012](http://www.senedd.assemblywales.org/documents/s11356/Adoption%20Report%20-%20November%202012.pdf \"National Assembly for Wales - Inquiry into Adoption\"). One recommendation involved the creation of a National Adoption Service for Wales and a functional model for the service has been proposed ([National Assembly for Wales, 2013](http://www.senedd.assemblywales.org/documents/s16595/Paper%204%20Deputy%20Minister%20for%20Social%20Services%20-%20Proposals%20for%20achieving%20a%20National%20Adoption%20Service%20i.pdf \"National Assembly for Wales - Adoptions Functional Knowledge\")).\n\nIt is possible that the increased number of adoptions in 2012 could be a consequence of the recent drive to improve the adoptions process in England and in Wales.\n\nThere have been small fluctuations in the number of adoptions since 1998. The largest fall in adoptions in England and Wales since 1998 occurred between 2005 and 2006. Special Guardianships were introduced on 30 December 2005 when the [Adoption and Children Act 2002](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/other/adoption-and-children-act-2002.html \"Adoption and Children Act 2002\") was fully implemented (see background note 3), and this may have had an impact as Special Guardianship figures are not included in ONS adoption statistics.\n\nSpecial Guardianship provided a new permanence option for children, giving a legally secure foundation for building a permanent relationship between the child and their special guardian, while preserving the legal link between the child and their birth family. The majority of Special Guardianship Orders are made to former foster carers. In 2006 there were 70 Special Guardianship orders granted [(Department for Education, 2011)](http://www.education.gov.uk/b0076713/datapack/adoption-special-guardianship-data-pack \"Adoption and Special Guardianships Data Pack\") rising to 2,130 by 2012 [(Department for Education, 2012c)](http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/219210/sfr20-2012v2.pdf \"Children Looked After - Statistical First Release\").\n"},{"title":"Adoptions by age and sex","markdown":"In 2012, there were 5,206 adoptions entered into the Adopted Children Register (ACR) following court orders made in England and Wales.

In 2012, 63% of children adopted were aged 1-4, compared with 34% in 1998 (Figure 3). In contrast, the percentage of adopted children who were aged 10-14 has more than halved from 21% in 1998 to 8.4% in 2012.\n\nSmaller decreases have been recorded for other age groups: In 2012, 24% of children adopted were aged 5-9 and 3.2% were aged 15-17, down from 36% and 5.0% respectively in 1998. Adoptions of children aged under 1 decreased overall from 4.6% of all adoptions in 1998 to 1.6% in 2011 before rising slightly to 2.2% in 2012.\n\n#### Figure 3: Adoptions by age group, 1998-2012\n##### England and Wales\n[![ALT-Text](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/fig3adoptionsbyagev2_tcm77-322843.png \"ALT-Text\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/fig3adoptionsbyagev2_tcm77-322843.png)\n#####Source: Office for National Statistics\n#####Notes:\n\n1.

The percentage of adopted children born outside marriage has increased steadily since 1998 and is much higher than the percentage of live births outside marriage, suggesting that children born outside marriage are more likely to be adopted than those born within marriage.\n\nBy way of illustration, in 2012 nearly half of all babies in England and Wales were born outside marriage/civil partnership (47%), compared with 38% in 1998. This continues the long-term rise in the percentage of births outside marriage/civil partnership [(ONS, 2013)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/birth-summary-tables--england-and-wales/2012/stb-births-in-england-and-wales-2012.html \"STB Births in England and Wales 2012\").\n\nThe Adopted Children Register (ACR) does not hold any information on the marital status of the adopting parents. Consequently, it is not possible to measure the impact of the implementation of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 on 30 December 2005 which allowed civil partners, same-sex couples and unmarried couples to adopt for the first time.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) now publishes statistics on the number of adoption orders issued to opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples, sole applicants and step-parents.

The adoption figures in this bulletin are based on the date of court order and do not include foreign adoptions. The court order data are seen as preferable as there may be a time lag between the date of the court order and the subsequent entry into the Register.\n\n2.
