Caution is needed when comparing census ethnic data over the years\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e due to changes and increases in tick boxes and changes to how the question was worded (change from cultural to ethnic background).\n\nWhile White continued to be the majority ethnic group people identify with, it decreased over the last two decades. In 1991, the White ethnic group\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e accounted for 94.1 per cent of the population. Between 1991 and 2001, the White ethnic group decreased to 91.3 per cent. The trend continued between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, with a further decrease to 86.0 per cent.

This includes people with Poland\u003csup\u003e4\u003c/sup\u003e as a country of birth, who were the second largest group of non-UK born residents in 2011 and increased by 0.5 million (a nine-fold increase) between 2001 and 2011.\n\n- The Asian/Asian British ethnic group categories had some of the largest increases between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses. People identifying as Pakistani and Indian each increased by around 0.4 million (0.5 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points respectively).\n\n- The remaining ethnic groups\u003csup\u003e5\u003c/sup\u003e each showed small increases of up to 1 per cent.\n\nThese trends are consistent with data from other sources\u003csup\u003e6\u003c/sup\u003e which show a decline in the White ethnic group and an increase in minority ethnic groups. There are many factors driving changes in ethnic group distribution including births, deaths, migration and country of birth.

This was due to an increased interest in \u0027national’ consciousness and demand from people to acknowledge their national identity.

Other interesting findings were:\n\n- The highest percentage of the population with an English identity (on its own or combined with other identities) was found in the North East at 80.5 per cent, an area with a high White population.\n\n- The highest percentage of the population with a British identity (on its own or combined with other identities) was found in London at 38.3 per cent, an ethnically diverse area.

However, within Cornwall 13.8 per cent of the population associated themselves with a Cornish identity.\n\n"},{"title":"Measuring ethnicity","markdown":"The England and Wales census first asked the ethnic group question in 1991. The ethnic group question provides information on the population’s ethnic characteristics which can be used by private and public organisations to monitor equal opportunities and anti-discrimination policies, and to plan for the future through resource allocation and informing provision of services. Since 1991 the number of tick boxes has grown from nine to 18 in 2011, with some changes to tick box labels, placement and question instructions.  Changes to the questionnaire were made to improve data collection and accuracy of the results, some improvements will affect direct comparability of 2011 and 2001 statistics.\n\n- The re-positioning of the \u0027Chinese\u0027 tick box from ‘Any other ethnic group’ to Asian/Asian British: The \u0027Asian other\u0027 and \u0027Asian\u0027 populations will not be comparable between 2001 and 2011.  It is advised against presenting data in a combined Asian category.  Instead the more detailed sub-groups should be used to allow comparability. There may be some impact on responses to the \u0027White and Asian\u0027 tick box under the \u0027Mixed/multiple ethnic groups\u0027 category.\n\n- New tick box ‘Gypsy or Irish Traveller’: Respondents may have identified in 2001 as ‘British’, ‘Irish’ or ‘Any other White background’ but instead use the new tick-box to identify as ‘Gypsy or Irish Traveller’ in 2011.\n\n- New tick box Arab: Data from the 2001 Census suggested that many British Arabs ticked one of the \u0027Other’ categories.\n\nComparisons are made in this short story with the 2001 Census ethnicity data where responses are comparable to 2011 Census. Further details of comparisons between the question in 2001 and 2011 can be found in the comparability report.\n\nThe list of tick-boxes had been designed to enable the majority of the population to identify themselves in a manageable way. It wasn’t possible to include a separate tick-box for all ethnic groups, therefore a tick-box with a write-in option for ‘Any Other’ background was provided within each of the five categories. This would ensure that minority groups were not excluded as they could write in their response. Some examples of what could be found within the written responses of the ‘Any Other’ ethnic groups could include:\n\n- ‘Any Other White’ - Polish and Greek,\n\n- ‘Any Other Mixed’ - Black British and White Asian and White and Black African,\n\n- ‘Any Other Asian’ – Korean and Japanese,\n\n- ‘Any Other Black’ - Black American and Black European,\n\n- ‘Any Other ethnic group’- Polynesian and Melanesian,\n\nIt is important to note that assumptions should not be made about a particular ethnic group, there are some people in ethnic minorities that could (or wish to) belong under any of the ‘Other’ categories.\n\n### Comparability with other sources\n\nThe Annual Population Survey is an ONS sample survey which also asks a question on ethnic group and follows similar trends to the census ethnic group question. Comparisons with the census should be treated with caution for methodological reasons. Between 2005 and 2010, respondents who identified as White fell from 89.8 per cent to 87.6 per cent, while Asian or Asian British increased from 4.9 per cent to 6.1 per cent. The remaining minority ethnic groups had increases of between 0.1 per cent to 0.4 per cent between 2005 and 2010.\n\n### Measuring national identity\n\nThe 2011 Census introduced a new question on national identity. National identity is a subjective self-identifying measure which may or may not relate to a person’s ethnic group or country of birth. The question (‘How would you describe your national identity?’) allows respondents to express which country/nation they feel most affiliated to. National identity is multi-dimensional, so the 2011 Census question allows respondents to tick more than one national identity.\n\nEthnicity and national identity is an important defining characteristic of a person’s identity. Collecting information on ethnicity and identity complements other questions on people’s religious affiliation and language to provide a detailed picture of the society we live in, and how it is changing.\n\n"},{"title":"More Census analysis","markdown":"[Census Analysis landing page](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html \"Census Analysis\")\n\n"}],"accordion":[{"title":"Background notes","markdown":"1.
