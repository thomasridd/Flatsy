The Annual Population Survey data in 2011 show 27.9 per cent  of the population in England and Wales have no religion, 63.1 per cent  are Christian, 4.8 per cent  are Muslim, 1.5 per cent  are Hindu while Buddhist, Jewish and Sikh each account for less than 1.0 per cent . However, comparisons between the census and social survey data should be treated with caution due to methodological differences.\n\nThere are many factors driving changes in religious affiliation including natural growth (for example, some minority religious groups have a younger demographic profile), migration, changes in willingness to report and awareness of the question. ONS will explore these factors further as part of its analysis programme of the census.\n\n### Notes for Changing picture of religious affiliation over last decade\n\n1. Some people selected the ‘Any Other Religion, write in’ box and specified their own religion. Note that in some cases these were reassigned to one of the main religions offered (eg. within the Christian group) or to ‘No religion’.\n\n2.

Tower Hamlets was the lowest at 27.1 per cent .

Blaenau Gwent, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Torfaen also saw large increases of no religion with 16.0, 15.5 and 15.4 percentage points respectively.\n\nIn London, the boroughs of Newham, Harrow, Brent and Redbridge had the lowest proportions of the population reporting no religion. Other areas under 15 per cent  included Slough in the South East, and Knowsley, Blackburn with Darwen, Copeland, Ribble Valley, and St Helens in the North West.\n\n### Map 2: Population reporting no religion, 2011, England and Wales local and unitary authorities\n\nMap 2 - Map\n\nMuslims tended to be concentrated in particular areas of England. In over half of local authorities the proportion of the population who were Muslim was under 1 per cent . In over three-quarters of areas it was under 6 per cent.\n\nThe areas with the highest proportion of Muslims were in London with the boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham having 34.5 per cent  and 32.0 per cent  respectively, and Redbridge and Waltham Forest having proportions of the population higher than 20 per cent . There were several areas outside London with proportions higher than 20 per cent  including Blackburn with Darwen in the North West (27.0 per cent ), Bradford in Yorkshire and the Humber, Luton in East of England, Slough in South East, and Birmingham in the West Midlands.\n\nThe proportion of Hindus was highest in the London boroughs of Harrow and Brent. Outside London, the highest proportion of Hindus was in Leicester. The biggest growth since 2001 was seen in Harrow where there was an increase of 5.7 percentage points.\n\nAffiliation with Budhism was predominantly greater within the London areas with the exception of Rushmoor which saw the highest increase since 2001 of 2.9 percentage points to 3.3 per cent.\n\nThere is a concentration of Jewish people in the London borough of Barnet and Hertsmere in the East of England, 15.2 per cent  and 14.3 per cent  of the population respectively.

The question (‘What is your religion?’) asks about religious affiliation, that is how we connect or identify with a religion, irrespective of actual practise or belief. Religion is a many sided concept and there are other aspects of religion such as religious belief, religious practice or belonging which are not covered in this analysis\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e.\n\nReligion is an important defining characteristic of people’s identity. Collecting information on religious affiliation complements other questions on people’s ethnic group, national identity and language to provide a detailed picture of the society we live in, and how it is changing.\n\n### Comparability with other sources\n\nThe Annual Population Survey, an ONS sample survey, asks a question on religious affiliation, although comparisons with the census should be treated with caution for methodological reasons. Between 2005 and 2010 the proportion of respondents reporting to be Christian fell from 77 per cent to 70 per cent, the proportion reporting no religion increased from 16 per cent to 21 per cent and the proportion reporting to be Muslim increased from 3.8 per cent to 4.8 per cent. The question changed in 2011 to be consistent with the census question. In 2011, 63.1 per cent  reported to be Christian, 27.9 per cent  as having no religion and 4.8 per cent  as Muslim.\n\n### Notes for Measuring religion\n\n1.
