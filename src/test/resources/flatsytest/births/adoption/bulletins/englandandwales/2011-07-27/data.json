This was lower than in 2009 (a 4.1 per cent decrease) but compared with longer term trends represents a period of relative stability.\n\nThe largest drop in adoptions over the last decade occurred between 2005 and 2006. Special Guardianships were introduced on 30 December 2005 when the Adoption and Children Act 2002 was fully implemented (see background note four), and this may have had an impact.\n\n"

      "markdown": "The chart below shows trends in adoptions by age group over the period 2000 to 2010. The proportion of children adopted aged one to four has steadily increased over the past decade. Fifty- eight per cent of children adopted in 2010 were aged one to four compared with 41 per cent in 2000.\n\nIn 2010, the proportion of children adopted who were aged five to nine was 26 per cent, an increase of 2 percentage points since 2009. However, the number and proportion of children adopted aged five to nine has declined significantly over the last decade, from 1,596 children (31 per cent) in 2000 to 1,141 children (26 per cent) in 2010. The proportion of children adopted who were aged 10 to 14 remained at 10 per cent in 2010, although this has decreased from 18 per cent in 2000.\n\n### Adoptions by age group\n#### England and Wales\n\nFigure 3 - Chart\n\n"

      "title": "Adoptions by marital status of biological parents",
      "markdown": "Of the children adopted in 2010, 80 per cent were born outside marriage compared with 69 per cent in 2000. The proportion of adopted children born outside marriage has increased steadily over the last decade and is much higher than the proportion of live births outside marriage suggesting that children born outside marriage are more likely to be adopted than those born within marriage.\n\nThe Adopted Children Register does not hold any information on the marital status of the adopting parents, so it is not possible to measure the impact of the implementation of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 on 30 December 2005 which allowed civil partners, same-sex couples and unmarried couples to adopt for the first time.\n\n"

They have the policy lead on adoptions and publish their own data on children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) by financial year. The Welsh Government also publishes data on adoptions, outcomes and placements for children looked after by local authorities in Wales by financial year.\nOrganisations such as the European Parliament and those in the voluntary sector, for example, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering use ONS’s adoption statistics for comparison purposes and also to support campaigns.\n\n"

To help the ONS determine user requirements and improve our outputs please take part in our user feedback survey on adoption statistics: [www.surveymonkey.com/s/3WK2KFR](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3WK2KFR \"Survey on adoption statistics\")\n\n2.  Data on adoptions are derived from the Adopted Children Register and are based on adoption orders made in England and Wales. The data here relates to those cases notified by the courts to the Registrar General and entered onto the Adopted Children Register in a given year. Adoption figures are produced on two definitions: date of entry into the Adopted Children Register and date of Court Order. The adoption figures in this bulletin are based on the date of court order and do not include foreign adoptions. The court order data are seen as preferable as there may be a time lag between the date of the court order and the subsequent entry into the Register.\n\n3.  Children are defined as being under 18 years of age.\n\n\n4.  On 30 December 2005 the Adoption and Children Act 2002 was fully implemented. It replaced the Adoption Act 1976 and modernised the legal framework for adoption in England and Wales. The Act provides for an adoption order to be made in favour of single people, married couples and, for the first time, civil partners, same-sex couples and unmarried couples. The Act also introduced Special Guardianship to provide permanence for children who cannot return to their birth families, but for whom adoption is not the most suitable option. Adoption and Children Act 2002 available at: [www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/38/contents](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/38/contents \"Adoption and Children Act 2002\")\n\n5.

The launch of the new ONS website on 28 August 2011 will bring changes to the design and format of statistical bulletins. The bulletin main body will be in html and pdf format but detailed data tables will be available as Excel spreadsheets only. The new website will improve the way users can access our statistics but many existing bookmarks and links will no longer work and users will need to update them.

Details of the policy governing the release of new data are available from the Media Relations\nOffice.\n\n8.  National Statistics are produced to high professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference.\n© Crown copyright 2011.\n\n9. **Media contact**:\n\nTel:\tLuke Croydon\t0845 6041858\nEmergency on-call\t07867 906553\nEmail: <media.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\n**Statistical contact**:\n\nTel: Elizabeth McLaren   01329 444553\nEmail: <elizabeth.mclaren@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\nWebsite: [www.ons.gov.uk](http://www.ons.gov.uk \"Office for National Statistics\")"
