Despite almost 1 in 10 having another main language other than English or Welsh, a much smaller percentage of the total population said they could either not speak English well or not at all. Some languages were concentrated in particular areas and these are reported on.\n\n- In March 2011 the Census showed that 49.8 million (92.3 per cent) of people aged three and over reported English (English or Welsh in Wales) as their main language.\n\n- 4.2 million people (7.7 per cent) reported another main language. Polish was the most popular \u0027Other\u0027 main language with 546,000 people reporting this as their main language (1.0 per cent of the total population). London had the highest proportion with another main language (22.1 per cent).\n\n- The local authority with the highest proportion of people with English (English or Welsh in Wales) as their main language was Redcar and Cleveland (99.3 per cent). The London Borough of Newham had the lowest proportion at 58.6 per cent.\n\n- Three quarters (3,000) of those who reported Yiddish as their main language were in the London borough of Hackney. Half (10,800) of those who reported Pakistani Pahari (with Mirpuri and Potwari) as their main language lived in Birmingham.\n\n- In England and Wales 726,000 people (1.3 per cent) reported that they could not speak English well and 138,000 people (0.3 per cent) reported that they could not speak English at all. London and the West Midlands saw the highest percentage of people who could not speak English well or not at all (4.1 per cent and 2.0 per cent respectively). Across local authorities, the percentage of people who could not speak English well or not at all was highest in Newham (8.7 per cent).\n"

      "title": "Measuring language",
      "markdown": "A question on main language and proficiency in speaking English was asked for the first time in the 2011 census. The question captured information through a tick-box on those who reported their main language as English (or English or Welsh in Wales). A write-in option captured languages other than English, this included Sign Languages. Those that selected the option for another language were asked a follow-up question on proficiency of English spoken. Respondents were asked how well they could speak English and could select one of the four tick boxes, ‘How well can you speak English?’ ‘very well’, ‘well’, ‘not well’, and ‘not at all’.\n\nLanguage is an important defining characteristic of people’s identity. Information from this question can be used with data collected from other identity questions such as ethnic group, national identity and religion to provide a detailed picture of England and Wales in 2011. The data also helps local authorities to target, deliver and facilitate the provision of public services, for example, to help identify the need for translation and the interpretation for providing English language lessons. ONS decided that meeting this need was essential for any language question.\n\nFuture releases of 2011 Census data will include multivariate tables (two or more variables for example, ethnic group by main language).This will enable more detailed analyses of the population’s characteristics to be published. \n"

This survey showed that in 2012, 92.2 per cent of the population in England and Wales had English (English and Welsh in Wales) as their ‘first language at home’. This figure has been steadily declining since 2003 (when the question was first asked) when it was 95.0 per cent showing a decrease of 2.8 percentage points overall.\n\nThis is broadly consistent with the 2011 Census, however, there should be caution when comparing the Census due to methodological differences - the LFS is a sample survey and asks a question on the ‘first language at home’ (every three years) and not ‘What is your main language’. \n"

The census provides estimates of the characteristics of all people and households in England and Wales on census night. These are produced for a variety of users including government, local and unitary authorities, business and communities. The census provides population statistics from a national to local level. This bulletin discusses the results at national and regional level.\n\n2. 2001 Census data are available via the [Neighbourhood Statistics](http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/Download1.do;jsessionid\u003dNYTQQFbJwFqpVC9y2Tx0kRxnvLXqKKwhk8phT1L71Z1bbRnHxxbJ!-48392752!1355144009249?\u0026nsjs\u003dtrue\u0026nsck\u003dtrue\u0026nssvg\u003dfalse\u0026nswid\u003d1916 \"NESS\") website.
