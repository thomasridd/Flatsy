Year of arrival in the UK counts the most recent year of arrival of those not born in the UK. For example an individual who arrives in 1961 and leaves in 1980 only to arrive again in 2005, will only be counted as arriving in 2005\n2. For each year of arrival an estimate is given of all those who were usually resident in England and Wales in 2011. It does not count anyone who left the country before the 2011 Census. This means that those arriving earlier have more ‘opportunity’ (in terms of time) to leave the country than those arriving more recently.\n3. The most recent time period of 2010 to 2011 is shorter than the other 3 year periods and consideration of the data should reflect this difference","altText":"","data":[{"":"Europe","Arrived 2001-2003":"201","Arrived 2004-2006":"551","Arrived 2007-2009":"548","Arrived 2010-2011":"245"},{"":"Africa","Arrived 2001-2003":"210","Arrived 2004-2006":"184","Arrived 2007-2009":"149","Arrived 2010-2011":"56"},{"":"Middle East and Asia","Arrived 2001-2003":"292","Arrived 2004-2006":"334","Arrived 2007-2009":"402","Arrived 2010-2011":"239"},{"":"The Americas and the Caribbean","Arrived 2001-2003":"64","Arrived 2004-2006":"61","Arrived 2007-2009":"92","Arrived 2010-2011":"52"},{"":"Antarctica and Oceania","Arrived 2001-2003":"19","Arrived 2004-2006":"25","Arrived 2007-2009":"34","Arrived 2010-2011":"21"}],"headers":["","Arrived 2001-2003","Arrived 2004-2006","Arrived 2007-2009","Arrived 2010-2011"],"series":["Arrived 2001-2003","Arrived 2004-2006","Arrived 2007-2009","Arrived 2010-2011"],"categories":["Europe","Africa","Middle East and Asia","The Americas and the Caribbean","Antarctica and Oceania"],"aspectRatio":"0.56","chartType":"barline","files":[{"type":"download-png","filename":"8ca1980c-download.png"},{"type":"png","filename":"8ca1980c.png"}],"chartTypes":{"Arrived 2001-2003":"bar","Arrived 2004-2006":"bar","Arrived 2007-2009":"bar","Arrived 2010-2011":"bar"},"groups":[["Arrived 2001-2003","Arrived 2004-2006","Arrived 2007-2009","Arrived 2010-2011"]]}
