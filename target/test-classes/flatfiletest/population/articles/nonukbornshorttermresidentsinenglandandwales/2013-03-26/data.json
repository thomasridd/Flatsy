      "markdown": "This story summarises data on non-UK born short-term residents (STRs) from the 2011 Census for England and Wales, conducted on 27 March 2011. Data are derived from census releases 1.1 (16 July 2012), 1.2 (24 September 2012) and 2.4 (26 March 2013), consisting of univariate tables. The 2011 Census is the first census of England and Wales to produce outputs relating to short-term residents. \n\nThe United Nations (UN) provides a definition of short-term migrants rather than short-term residents.  The UN definition of a short-term migrant is someone who changes their country of usual residence for between 3 and 12 months for the purpose of work or study. The Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) short-term migration estimates are produced to this definition, and cover both UK-born and non-UK born short-term migrants. The national estimates also cover the broader group of short-term migrants who change their country of usual residence for 1 to 12 months for any reason. ONS measures short-term migration by identifying the actual time spent living in the UK from departing short-term migrants interviewed by the [International Passenger Survey](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/travel-and-transport-methodology/international-passenger-survey-methodology/index.html \"International Passenger Survey\") (IPS).\n\nThe ONS definition of a short-term resident differs from that of a short-term migrant. A ‘short-term resident’ (STR) was defined in the 2011 Census as anyone living in England and Wales who was born outside the UK and who intended to stay in the UK for a period of between 3 and 12 months, for any reason. These data represent the stock of non-UK born short-term residents at a particular point in time (those present on 27 March 2011), and are not estimates of short-term migration moves (measured by [short-term migrant estimates](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/short-term-migration/short-term-migration-estimates-for-england-and-wales/mid-2010-estimates/stb-stm-mid2010.html \"STB Short-Term Migrants mid-2010\") produced by ONS).  Estimates of short-term residents and migrants are used by central and local government to assess community needs and inform demands for public services such as education and health; they can also be useful to explain differences between ONS population estimates, which do not include short-term migrants, and various administrative sources which include both short and long-term migrants.\n\nThere were estimated\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e to be 195,000 STRs in England and Wales on 27 March 2011. This means there were 35 STRs per 10,000 usual residents\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e. The 2011 Census estimated that the usually resident population was 56.1 million; this includes 7.5 million non-UK born usual residents. The non-UK born short-term residents are not included within this total figure. The latest available short-term migrant estimates\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e for the year to mid-2010 estimated 214,000 short-term migrant visits to England and Wales; this is 19,000 more than the stock of short-term residents in the 2011 Census but will include some UK-born short-term migrants.  Furthermore, most of the short-term migrants arriving in the year to mid-2010 would have left England and Wales by census day 2011. A reconciliation report will be published by ONS in May 2013 that addresses differences between the STR estimates and short-term migration estimates.\n\n### Notes\n\n1. The same system of estimation was used for short-term residents as for usual residents. Hence the estimate includes those that are estimated to be present but who did not respond to the census. For further information on the estimation process see “[Trout, Catfish and Roach: The beginner’s guide to census population estimates](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/search/index.html?newquery\u003dtrout,%20catfish \"Trout, Catfish and Roach: The beginner’s guide to census population estimates\")”\n\n2. The usually resident population refers to people who live in the UK for 12 months or more, including those who have been resident for less than 12 months but intend to stay for a total period of 12 months or more. The population base for the 2011 Census was the usually resident population of England and Wales, defined as anyone who, on the night of 27 March 2011, was either (a) resident in England and Wales and who had been resident, or intended to be resident in the UK for a period of 12 months or more, or (b) resident outside the UK but had a permanent England and Wales address and intended to be outside the UK for less than a year\n\n3. This ONS report on reconciliation of 2011 Census estimates of STRs and estimates of short-term immigration to England and Wales is based upon the International Passenger Survey (IPS). IPS-based estimates will include UK-born people who reside in an overseas country and migrate to the UK for a short period (3 to 12 months); the census excludes this group of migrants from its estimates of short-term residents\n\n"

Overall, the STR\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e population was relatively younger than the usually resident population: nearly 70 per cent (135,000)\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e of STRs were aged 15 to 29; within that age range the majority (77,000) were aged 20 to 24 years, indicating that many may be in the UK for study purposes (see economic status section below). In the usually resident population, those aged 15 to 29 accounted for 20 per cent (11.2 million); of these 3.8 million were aged 20 to 24.\n\nThe STR population aged 65 and over accounted for 2.9 per cent (6,000) of all STRs, with 0.8 per cent aged 75 and over (2,000).

Passport held is used to determine nationality in this analysis.\n\nThe 195,000 STRs included 10,000 non-UK born British nationals and 2,000 Irish nationals who were present here on census day, even though they were not usually resident in the UK. There were 178,000 non-UK and non-Irish passports held by STRs\u003csup\u003e4\u003c/sup\u003e who were not British or Irish nationals in England and Wales at the time of the 2011 Census\u003csup\u003e5\u003c/sup\u003e. The remaining 5,000 STRs stated that they did not have a passport; many of these may have been European Economic Area (EEA) citizens travelling on national identity cards.\n\n#### Figure 6: Census question 22 on passports held, 2011\n\nFigure 6 - Image\n\nFigure 7 summarises the top 10 nationalities of STRs. These top 10 nationalities accounted for 53 per cent (103,000) of all STRs. As with data presented for country of birth, India heads the list with 10 per cent of all STRs in England and Wales being Indian nationals; this is followed by Chinese (10 per cent) and American (5 per cent). These are followed by a range of EU countries and Pakistan. A key difference from the country of birth data is that non-UK born British passport holders are included and account for 5 per cent (10,000) of all STRs.\n\n### Figure 7: Top 10 nationalities within total STR population for England and Wales, 2011\n\nFigure 7 - Chart\n\nFigure 8 presents the top three nationalities for STRs for each English region and Wales in 2011. Indian is the most reported nationality for STRs, being present in the top three in all regions. Chinese is present in the top three in nine regions, though it is notably absent from the top three in London. British is present in the top three in four regions; the British category will include children born to British nationals abroad, including those in the armed forces. German and American are included in the top three in two regions, while French, Polish and Malaysian feature in the top three in one region each. \n\n### Figure 8: Top three nationalities for STRs for each English region and Wales, 2011\n\nFigure 8 - Chart\n\nFigure 8 also shows how the contribution made by the top three nationalities found in the STRs in each region can vary, depending on the range of different nationalities in each region. For example, the top three nationalities in the North East sum to 36 per cent of the total STR population there, while in the South East the top three sum to only 22 per cent. There is therefore considerable variation in the range and diversity of nationalities in the regional STR populations.\n\nTable 4 shows the three countries of birth\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e where there are more passports held than STRs born there; Portugal has the highest ratio with 144 passports for every 100 STRs born in Portugal. This may be because many people born in former Portuguese colonies such as Angola and Mozambique have Portuguese nationality. The three countries of birth with the lowest ratios are also shown; Somalia has the least with 9 passports held for every 100 STRs born in Somalia. This low ratio may be due to Somalis obtaining UK or Italian nationality (these are the two former colonial powers that controlled the territory of what is now Somalia) while some may have acquired dual nationality\u003csup\u003e5\u003c/sup\u003e.\n\n### Table 4: Ratio of country of birth to nationality of short-term residents, 2011\n\nTable 4 - Table\n\n### Notes for passports held (to determine nationality)\n\n1. While country of birth remains constant, people may change their nationality over time or acquire dual nationality; accordingly there are differences between the data presented for country of birth and passports held. \n\n2. The terms “passports held”, “nationality”, and “citizenship” are used interchangeably in this document. \n\n3. This question should not be confused with census question 15, which deals with national identity (“How would you describe your national identity?”). Whereas passport held (nationality) is an objective measure, national identity is a subjective self-defining measure. In this short story we do not use national identity as it does not indicate a person’s migration status. \n\n4. Short-term residents (STRs) were identified in the census as people who were born and usually live outside the UK, who are intending to stay in the UK for between 3 and 12 months, and who were in England or Wales on 27 March 2011. \n\n5. Some people may hold more than one passport. If someone has more than one passport, one of which is British, then they are recorded in the British category. If someone does not have a British passport but holds more than one passport, one of which is Irish, then they are recorded in the Irish category. If someone has neither a UK nor an Irish passport, then they are coded according to the response written in the \"other\" passport box (see figure 6). In table AP1202EW (Passports held (non-UK born short-term residents)) the number of passports is the same as the number of STRs, whereas in Table KS205EW (Passports held) used in [International Migrants in England and Wales 2011](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-international-migrants.html \"International Migrants in England and Wales 2011\") the number of passports held by usual residents was greater than the number of residents owing to dual nationality. \n\n"

The population base for the 2011 Census was the usually resident population of England and Wales, defined as anyone who, on the night of 27 March 2011, was either (a) resident in England and Wales and who had been resident, or intended to be resident in the UK for a period of 12 months or more, or (b) resident outside the UK but had a permanent England and Wales address and intended to be outside the UK for less than a year. \n\n4. Economic activity data for the usually resident population includes those aged 16 to 74.  Economic activity data for the STR population are for those aged 16 and over; therefore the two are not directly comparable. \n\n5. Data derived from Table QS603EW 2011 Census: Economic activity - Full-time students, local authorities in England and Wales. \n\n6. A short-term resident aged 16 and over is defined as employed (or in employment) if in the week before the census they carried out at least one hour\u0027s paid work, either as an employee or self-employed. This includes casual or temporary work, on a government-sponsored training scheme, doing paid or unpaid work for their own or family business, being away from work ill, or on holiday or temporarily laid off. This excludes full–time students who are working. \n\n7. Some numbers and percentages throughout this report may not sum due to rounding. \n\n"

This publication follows the [2011 Census Population and Household Estimates for England \u0026 Wales](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/population-and-household-estimates-for-england-and-wales/index.html \"Population and household estimates for England and Wales\"). The census provides estimates of the characteristics of all people and households in England and Wales on census day. These are produced for a variety of users including government, local and unitary authorities, business and communities. The census provides population statistics from a national to local level. This short story discusses the results for England and Wales. \n\n2. 2011 Census data are available via the [Neighbourhood Statistics](http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/Download1.do;jsessionid\u003dm3k2QF9QfQHwZJDdybvLTw9ykhpGQKrBzQrFh2KwzLqJBHrMlvh9!-48392752!1355152656563?\u0026nsjs\u003dtrue\u0026nsck\u003dtrue\u0026nssvg\u003dfalse\u0026nswid\u003d1020 \"Neighbourhood Statistics\") website. Relevant table numbers are provided in all download files within this publication. \n\n3. Interactive [data visualisations](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/interactive/index.html \"Data visualisations\") developed by ONS are also available to aid interpretation of the results. \n\n4. Future releases from the 2011 Census will include more detail in cross tabulations, and tabulations at other geographies. These include wards, health areas, parliamentary constituencies, postcode sectors and national parks. Further information on future releases is available online in the [2011 Census Prospectus](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-prospectus/index.html \"2011 Census Prospectus\"). \n\n5. ONS has ensured that the data collected meet users\u0027 needs via an extensive [2011 Census outputs consultation](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/consultations--users-and-local-partners/index.html \"Consultations, users and local partners\") process in order to ensure that the 2011 Census outputs will be of increased use in the planning of housing, education, health and transport services in future years. \n\n6. Any reference to local authorities includes both local and unitary authorities. \n\n7. Some numbers and percentages throughout this report may not sum due to rounding. \n\n8. ONS is responsible for carrying out the census in England and Wales. Simultaneous but separate censuses took place in Scotland and Northern Ireland. These were run by the National Records of Scotland (NRS) and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) respectively. \n\n9. A person\u0027s place of usual residence is in most cases the address at which they stay the majority of the time. For many people this will be their permanent or family home. If a member of the services did not have a permanent or family address at which they are usually resident, they were recorded as usually resident at their base address. \n\n10. All key terms used in this publication are explained in the [2011 Census glossary](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-user-guide/glossary/index.html \"2011 Census glossary\"). Information on the [2011 Census geography products for England and Wales](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/census/index.html \"Geography products for England and Wales\") is also available. \n\n11. The coverage assessment and adjustment methodology developed for the census involved the use of standard statistical techniques, similar to those used by many other countries, for measuring, and adjusting for, the level of undercount in the census and providing an assessment of characteristics of individuals and households missed this way. ONS adjusted the 2011 Census counts to include estimates of people and households not counted. The methodology was used for both usual residents and short-term residents.  Hence the census short-term resident estimates include those that are estimated to be present but who did not respond to the census. \n\n12. All census population estimates were extensively quality assured, using other national and local sources of information for comparison and review by a series of quality assurance panels. An extensive range of [quality assurance, evaluation and methodology papers](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-user-guide/quality-and-methods/index.html \"Quality and Methods\") were published alongside the first release in July 2012 and have been updated, including a [Quality and Methodology document](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-user-guide/quality-and-methods/index.html \"Quality and Methods index\"). \n\n13. The 2011 Census achieved an overall response rate of 94 per cent of the usually resident population of England and Wales, and over 80 per cent in all local and unitary authorities. The population estimate for England and Wales of 56.1 million is estimated with 95 per cent confidence to be accurate to within +/- 85,000 (0.15 per cent). The response rates for short-term residents were 73 per cent for residents intending to stay three to six months and 81 per cent for residents intending to stay six to 12 months. This is lower than the response rate of 94 per cent for the usually resident population. As a result, the estimates of short-term residents are not of the same high quality as the census estimates for the usually resident population of England and Wales. \n\n14. Details of the policy governing the release of new data are available by visiting [www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/index.html](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/index.html) or from the Media Relations Office email: \u003cmedia.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk\u003e\n\nThese National Statistics are produced to high professional standards and released according to the arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority."
